We are pleased to announce that Hao Ye, Simona Picardi and Sergio Marconi were awarded [travel awards](/awards/) for fall 2019 and spring 2019. Congratulations to all three of them!

Hao used his travel funds to attend the [2019 eLife Innovation Sprint](https://sprint.elifesciences.org/). He reports:

> I traveled to Cambridge, UK to participate in the 2019 eLife Innovation Sprint. eLife (the scientific journal/publisher) hosts this annual event to support and promote work on prototypes to improve scientific publishing, open access, etc.I worked as part of the "Equitable Preprints" team, whose goal was to improve visibility and equitability of preprints. Although preprints lower the barrier for scientists to share their work with the world, the social structures that filter and disseminate preprints still embody the same inequities of the peer-reviewed literature (e.g. reputation and prestige, social networks, geopolitical and gender biases). The prototype, [Hidden Preprints](https://hiddenpreprints.org), uses the Rxivist dataset to identify bioRxiv preprints in each bioRxiv category with low initial view counts.

> My travel to the sprint enabled me to meet and interact with a diverse range of people working in open science/open access across different domains and geographical regions. In addition to making valuable connections, I also had the opportunity to work  on a project that is of both personal and professional interest to me. We are planning to continue updating and refining the tool, as well as publicize the issue of preprint equitability in various forms and places, which will document my contributions (for academic credit).

> The UF Carpentries Club, like the parent organization of The Carpentries, values inclusion and accessibility in its mission of teaching computational skills to researchers. Both the perspective of the organization, and the ways in which it is implemented (e.g. pedagogy that promotes empathy for users) were useful to me in participating in the sprint. My experiences on the board of the UF Carpentries Club also helped to prepare me for working with a diverse group to design and develop a working prototype in a limited time.

We would like to thank all applicants for their support -- please do apply again next year!
