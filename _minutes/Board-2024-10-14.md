### Online workshop
* DEP confirmed they have 14 people for the week of October 28th
* Must decide time for 2 consecutive days from 9 to 5 with a one hour lunch break - maybe the 28th-29th -> yes lets confirm this

* Calvin: send email to DEP to confirm this time
* Flora: will send email that Vaasuki made the template for and create the registration form
* This will be a free workshop, with no fee
* See how many volunteers for helpers we have and then possibly increase registration limit, but for now, keep it at 20 total, or 5 open to UF students
* Make clear to DEP point of contact that this is a 2-day workshop and the later sessions are dependent on the first sessions
* Sending to ecology relate departments first is good, so we don't get too many people trying to register, since we only have 5 spots to fill
