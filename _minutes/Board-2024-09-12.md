## Notes
<!-- Other important details discussed during the meeting can be entered here. -->

### Introductions
* 

### Membership renewal
* Julie from the library as well as Flora figured out we do not have enough money for membership dues
* It has been pledged we think but it has not been given to us yet
* We are short $600 for the membership dues
* Ke will follow up with Julie and new directors of informatics institute, who we can then email after this
* After we get this we can renew membership

### Online workshop
* Online ecology workshop - Cory had email exchange with the person who wants to do this
* Calvin is interested in getting involved in this workshop
* This would work the same way as what we used to do and invite the ecology org/department to sign up first since they requested it
* No specific day yet - we would want to check with them about this
* Vaasuki may also want to teach in this
* Calvin will start to organize this and take communications forward - work with Vaasuki on this
* Use institutional instructions for how to organize a workshop
* R for ecologists workshop from carpentries club
* State employee workshop would be completely online
* Have specific date of workshop by next week

### Tabline events update
* Because we get funding from UF departments, we are not able to do tabling, it is a different type of organization

### Semester workshop and recruiting events
* The online workshop for federal employees can be opened up to UF affiliated peoples - make a website using resources for this
* URLs for workshop planning: https://docs.carpentries.org/topic_folders/hosts_instructors/hosts_instructors_checklist.html and https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-O1rKkVga5Ok1HXbH9ShI-buRoD53SzpErtzUJTXEFw/edit#heading=h.k7r8s9xh4tnu
