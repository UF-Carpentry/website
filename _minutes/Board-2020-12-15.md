  - Virtual workshop should be smaller in size
  - Make it clear that we have office hours during the breaks to address questions that participants might have
  - Recommend having 2nd monitor for the workshop for participants to manage online sessions, R studio and slack discussion
  - A script to be provided to participants for them to run and make sure system is set up correctly
  - Let us keep the workshop free
  - Follow up email for confirmation of participation to make sure we have higher participation
  - Set up workshop website by copying the repo
  - Open Registration two days after session starts
    - Do contact managers of email listservs ahead of time, so that the post can go up on the correct date
  - Participants 30 and at least 3 helpers
